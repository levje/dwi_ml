                                Batch sampler

Defines how to sample the streamlines available in the MultiSubjectData.

- Defines the __iter__ method:
    - Finds a list of streamlines ids and associated subj that you can later
    load in your favorite way.

    - It is possible to restrict the number of subjects in a batch (and thus
    the number of inputs to load associated with sampled streamlines), and to
    reduce the number of time we need to load new data by using the same
    subjects for a given number of "cycles".

USAGE:
Can be used in a torch DataLoader. For instance:
        # Initialize dataset
        dataset = MultiSubjectDataset(...)
        dataset.load_training_data()
        # Initialize batch sampler
        batch_sampler = BatchSampler(...)
        # Use this in the dataloader
        dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_sampler=batch_sampler,
                                collate_fn=batch_loader.load_batch)

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset : MultisubjectSubset
            Dataset to sample from.
        streamline_group_name: str
            The name of the group to use to load the sequences among all
            streamline_groups in the data_source.
        batch_size_training : int
            Batch size. Can be defined in number of streamlines or in total
            length_mm (specified through batch_size_units).
        batch_size_validation: Union[int, None]
            Idem. If None, it is expected that there will not be a validation
            set.
        batch_size_units: str
            'nb_streamlines' or 'length_mm' (which should hopefully be
            correlated to the number of input data points).
        nb_streamlines_per_chunk: int
            In the case of a batch size in terms of 'length_mm', chunks of n
            streamlines are sampled at once, and then their size is checked,
            either removing streamlines if exceeded, or else sampling a new
            chunk of ids. Default = None in the case of 'nb_streamlines' units,
            or 256 in the case of 'length_mm' (for no good reason).
        rng : int
            Seed for the random number generator. Default = None.
        nb_subjects_per_batch : int
            Maximum number of subjects to be used in a single batch. Depending
            on the model, this can avoid loading too many input volumes at the
            same time, for example. Default: None (always sample from all
            subjects).
        cycles : int
            Used if `nb_subjects_per_batch` is given. Number of batches
            re-using the same subjects (and thus the same volumes) before
            sampling new ones. Default: None.
